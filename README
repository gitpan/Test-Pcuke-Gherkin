Test-Pcuke-Gherkin

This package provides Gherkin language lexer, parser and the wrapper
around the two former. Using the wrapper you can build an abstract syntax tree
form the text in Gherkin language and execute it using custom executor object.

Thus you can build your own BDD cucumber-like tool (if you don't like any of the existing
clones)
